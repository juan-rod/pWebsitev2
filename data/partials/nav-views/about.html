	<!-- <h1>about</h1> -->
	<!-- <p>Hello, World! I'm a recent graduate from Nashville Software School, an intensive coding bootcamp that cultivated my passion for web development. I like to describe myself as adaptable, diligent, and intuitive! When I'm not coding you can catch me cooking, reading a spacefaring novel, and learning something new...all at the same time.</p> -->
